For this lab, you will create a website that uses Vue for the front end. This website can be for anything you want, but should not be the same as the Vue apps we have already built so far. You must create your own original work. Your creative projects can build on each other.'

Originality
It should not be too similar to the website you built for previous labs or activities. You must create your own original work.  If your project is substantially similar to previous assignments, the TAs will give you zero points and you can redo it, with late penalties applied as appropriate. What you want to avoid is copying an existing project and changing onlyt the style or mock data. You should be writing substantial code on your own so that you can gain additional mastery of the material. You can ask your TA for guidance on what constitutes an original work before coding.

Functionality
Your site should include substantial functionality, including the ability for users to create, edit, and delete data on the site. Since we do not yet have a back end, it is OK if the data resets when the site is reloaded. Sites that only present data rather than allowing users to manipulate data will be penalized.

Pair Programming
You are welcome to work alone or in a group of two on this project.  if you work as a pair, you need to follow the pair programming guidelines in the syllabus, contribute equally, and turn in the same URL.  

Requirements
This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. It should not be too similar to the website you built for Lab 3a or 3b. You must create your own original work.  The basic requirements are:

- The site uses Vue and the Vue CLI
- The site uses the Vue Router, so there are at least two pages.
- The site has substantial functionality, allowing a user to create, edit, and delete data.
- The site has some mock data that is at least as detailed as the mock data used in the prior lab.
- The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository
The GitHub repository should be in your own GitHub account and should be a public repository.

If you are building off a an old creative project it should have new functionality or new pages.

Submission
Please submit to Canvas the URL for your web server, where your code is running (e.g. on your DigitalOcean server). On this website, in a footer, you must include a link to your GitHub repository. Use a unique URL for the project, e.g. cp3.emmasmith.org.

If you worked with a pair programming partner, both of you should submit the assignment and both of you should list the other person's name in the website footer and in the assignment submission.

Rubric for Grading
We will grade your projects based on the attached rubric.
